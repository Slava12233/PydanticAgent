# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.


# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. 
- When integrating Logfire with httpx, you need to install the additional package `logfire[httpx]` to enable HTTP request monitoring.
- Always call `logfire.configure()` before using any other Logfire functions.
- Use `logfire.span()` for tracking longer operations and `logfire.info()`, `logfire.error()` for specific events.
- Remember to add proper cleanup with `logfire.force_flush()` and `logfire.shutdown()` to ensure all logs are sent.
- For multilingual documentation, include both Hebrew and English versions in the README.md file to make the project accessible to a wider audience.
- Maintain a modular architecture by separating concerns into different files (e.g., agent.py for AI logic, main.py for bot interface).
- When configuring timeouts in python-telegram-bot, use the defaults parameter in Application.builder() instead of trying to modify the _request.timeout attribute directly. The timeout is a tuple, not a single value.
- In python-telegram-bot v21.10, use a single 'timeout' key in the defaults dictionary instead of separate timeout types like 'connect_timeout', 'read_timeout', etc.
- In python-telegram-bot v21.10, use the Defaults class instead of a dictionary for the defaults parameter, and make sure to include tzinfo (e.g., datetime.timezone.utc).
- In python-telegram-bot v21.10, the Defaults class does not accept any timeout parameters. Timeouts must be configured elsewhere, not in the Defaults object.
- In python-telegram-bot v21.10, use the ApplicationBuilder methods (read_timeout, write_timeout, connect_timeout, pool_timeout) to set timeout values instead of trying to set them in the Defaults object.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- The project uses Pydantic AI as the main framework for AI integration, which provides a clean interface for working with LLMs
- The Telegram bot is implemented using python-telegram-bot library and supports Hebrew language
- SQLite is used for storing chat history with a simple schema
- Logfire provides comprehensive monitoring for AI applications, tracking HTTP requests, database operations, and model interactions
- When working with Telegram bots, increase timeout values to prevent "Timed out" errors during API calls
- Use a modular architecture with separate files for bot logic, agent implementation, and main application flow

# Scratchpad
